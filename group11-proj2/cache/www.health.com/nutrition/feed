    <![CDATA[Five simple RD-approved tips for balancing fatty acids in your diet.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>One important key to fighting obesity and other chronic diseases? Fewer omega-6 fatty acids in our diet, and <a href="http://openheart.bmj.com/content/3/2/e000385.full?sid=acd05aa3-4e5f-4680-83bb-63aef173896f">more omega-3s</a>, according to&nbsp;the authors of a new editorial published in the journal <em>Open Heart</em>.</p>

<p>Both types of fatty acids are essential for the body: Omega-6s&mdash;found in vegetable oils like sunflower, safflower, and corn oil&mdash;play a role in brain function, growth and development, reproductive health, and promote healthy hair, skin, and bones. Omega-3s&mdash;found in fatty fish&mdash;reduce inflammation, regulate blood pressure, and are crucial for the brain and heart. They&rsquo;re also tied to a lower risk of many conditions, including diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, stroke, arthritis, asthma, and some cancers.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s important&nbsp;to strike a balance between the two nutrients. As the authors of the editorial point out, humans beings evolved on a diet that contained equal amounts of both. Today, they report, thanks to technological advances and modern farming practices, Americans now eat sixteen times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3s.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a problem because while omega-3s are anti-inflammatory, omega-6s tend to be pro-inflammatory. Therefore when omega-6 intake is high and omega-3 intake is low, the result is excess inflammation and boost in the production of body fat.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;drastic imbalance in the Western&nbsp;diet has been tied to more than just obesity. It&#39;s also been linked to diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, depression, pain, inflammatory conditions like asthma, and autoimmune illnesses.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are a few&nbsp;simple ways to consume&nbsp;more&nbsp;omega-3s&nbsp;while&nbsp;dialing&nbsp;back on omega-6s. Here are five steps you can take&nbsp;toward a healthier balance:</p>

<h3><strong>Check ingredients</strong></h3>

<p>Processed foods&mdash;everything from frozen meals to canned soup, crackers, and salad dressing&mdash;may be loaded with omega-6s, due to the vegetable oils used by manufacturers. Check labels and curtail or avoid products that contain&nbsp;corn oil, soybean, sunflower, safflower, and cottonseed oils. The same goes for fast food, which is also typically made with those oils high in omega-6s. You can look up the ingredients in various menu items online.</p>

<h3><strong>Buy organic, grass-fed meat and dairy products</strong></h3>

<p>Research shows that foods that come from grass-fed and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878105" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878105">organically</a>&nbsp;raised animals contain more omega-3s.&nbsp;Grass-fed beef, for example packs about 50% more omega-3s than regular beef. (For more info, check out my&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/grass-fed-beef-tips" href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/grass-fed-beef-tips">post</a>&nbsp;all about&nbsp;grass-fed meat.)</p>

<h3><strong>Replace margarine with&nbsp;EVOO</strong></h3>

<p>Since margarine is&nbsp;typically made with oils high in omega-6s, I recommend ditching it. In its place, use extra virgin olive oil (which is low in omega-6s) or grass-fed butter (which is higher in omega-3s than conventional&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/10/05/is-butter-bad-for-you-what-you-should-know/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/10/05/is-butter-bad-for-you-what-you-should-know/">butter</a>).</p>

<h3><strong>Eat more</strong>&nbsp;<strong>fish</strong>&nbsp;<strong>high in omega-3s</strong></h3>

<p>The best sources include salmon, sardines, rainbow trout, and mackerel. If you&#39;re not a fan of&nbsp;fish, consider talking to your doctor or&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/30/6-things-you-should-know-about-working-with-a-nutritionist-dietitian/?hootPostID=0178e9e302582d86951f41cfad61e2ce" href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/30/6-things-you-should-know-about-working-with-a-nutritionist-dietitian/?hootPostID=0178e9e302582d86951f41cfad61e2ce">dietitian</a>&nbsp;about a fish oil supplement. He or she can help you choose a brand&nbsp;that provides the right amount of DHA and EPA,&nbsp;the types of&nbsp;omega-3s in fish, for your health needs.</p>

<h3><b>Load up on plants</b></h3>

<p>Eating more produce helps displace processed foods that may be sources of omega-6s. Plus, some plant foods contain a type of omega-3 fatty acid called ALA. It has a different chemical structure than the more beneficial DHA and EPA found in fatty fish;&nbsp;but a&nbsp;small percentage of ALA can be converted to DHA and EPA in your body. The&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/84/1/44.long" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/84/1/44.long">more ALA</a>&nbsp;you consume, the better.</p>

<p>ALA is found in&nbsp;nuts and seeds like walnuts, chia seeds, and flax,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, dark leafy greens, and berries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In general, I recommend aiming&nbsp;for three to five servings of veggies, and two servings of fruit per day. Each serving should be about a cup (or the size of a tennis ball when raw). One way to do this is to include veggies at all three&nbsp;meals: Add them to your breakfast smoothie or omelet, eat a salad at lunch, and include a few servings of vegetables (steamed, saut&eacute;ed, oven&nbsp;roasted, or grilled)&nbsp;at dinner. As for fruit, have a serving at breakfast, and a&nbsp;second serving as a&nbsp;mid-day snack.&nbsp;Also, sprinkle nuts and seeds into smoothies, oatmeal, salads, and stir fys. Better balance, achieved.&nbsp;</p>

    <![CDATA[But we should be eating even more. Here are five reasons to add extra servings of seafood to your diet.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>The American diet has a pretty bad rap (and with reason).&nbsp;But based on new government statistics, things may be looking up: According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#39;s&nbsp;annual <a href="http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/fus/fus15/index">Fisheries of the United States</a>&nbsp;report, Americans increased their consumption of fish and shellfish to 15.5 pounds per person in 2015. That&rsquo;s a leap of nearly four pounds from the prior year&mdash;and also the greatest rise in two decades.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;bump is a major win for public health, says <em>Health</em>&nbsp;contributing nutrition editor Cynthia Sass, RD, MPH:&nbsp;&quot;The trend towards eating more fish has the potential to reduce obesity and chronic disease stats in the U.S., particularly if the fish we&#39;re eating are high in omega-3 fatty acids, and prepared and cooked healthfully.&quot;</p>

<p>But there&#39;s still room for improvement.&nbsp;Our weekly average of 4.77&nbsp;ounces of seafood falls short of the&nbsp;8 ounces per week recommended by the current&nbsp;<a href="http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/">Dietary Guidelines</a>. Below, we&#39;ve rounded up five excellent excuses to <a href="http://news.health.com/2015/02/16/how-to-eat-all-the-fish-you-want-minus-the-mercury-danger/">add more&nbsp;more fish</a> to your diet, starting today.</p>

<h3><strong>Fish are good for your heart</strong></h3>

<p>Thanks to their ample supply of omega-3s, fatty fish (like salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines) are a prime <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20720182,00.html#salmon--0">heart-healthy food</a>. Studies have shown omega-3s can decrease&nbsp;triglycerides, and lower the risk of <a href="http://www.health.com/health/arrhythmia/">arrhythmia</a>&nbsp;(an irregular heart beat), and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20307165,00.html">atherosclerosis</a> (plaque build-up in the arteries). The <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Fish-and-Omega-3-Fatty-Acids_UCM_303248_Article.jsp">American Heart Association</a> recommends having at least two serving of&nbsp;fish (and ideally&nbsp;fatty fish) every week.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/omega-3-balance">Eating Too Many Omega-6s Could Be Wrecking Your Health. Here&#39;s How to Fix It</a></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Seafood provides key nutrients</strong></h3>

<p><a href="http://news.health.com/2014/12/04/calories-in-shrimp/">Shrimp</a>, for example, are not only rich in protein, but also contain&nbsp;two antioxidants that have been shown to help stave off aging and disease. Clams are loaded with potassium,&nbsp;as well as the <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/vitamin-b12-foods#clams-pasta">highest concentration of B12</a> of any food. Six raw <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/vitamin-b12-foods#grilled-oysters">oysters contain 32 mg of zinc</a>, 400% the recommended daily amount. And fatty fish are chock-full of <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20504538,00.html#fatty-fish-0">vitamin D</a>. Those are just a few examples of the nutritional perks of seafood; to reap the benefits,&nbsp;it&#39;s key to eat a variety of fish and shellfish, says Sass. Every so often, swap your go-to salmon filet for shrimp&nbsp;or clams, she suggests.</p>

<h3><strong>Fish could help with anxiety and depression</strong></h3>

<p>Eating seafood may offer some natural protection against <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20669377,00.html#eat-omega-3s--0">anxiety and depression</a>.&nbsp;In one study, medical students who had 2.5 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids daily for 12 weeks showed lower <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21784145">levels of anxiety</a> on the day of an exam than those who took a placebo. Research has also shown that people who eat fish regularly are less likely to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976923/">become depressed</a>. And in parts of the world <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20526272,00.html#fish-oil-6">where seafood is a diet staple</a>, people tend to have lower levels of depression.</p>

<h3><strong>And protect your&nbsp;memory</strong></h3>

<p>Fatty fish are rich in an omega-3 called docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, which plays a key role in the brain.&nbsp;&ldquo;DHA seems to be very important for the normal <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20434658,00.html/view-all#fish-1">functioning of neurons</a>,&rdquo; Martha Clare Morris, ScD, director of the section on nutrition and nutritional epidemiology in the Department of Internal Medicine at Rush University, in Chicago, told <em>Health</em> in a prior interview.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, research from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine&nbsp;found that people who regularly ate fish had larger volumes of gray matter in regions of the brain associated with <a href="http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2814%2900257-8/abstract">memory and cognition</a>. But keep in mind, the people in&nbsp;this study ate fish that was&nbsp;baked or broiled (not fried!). So be sure to <a href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/24/tips-for-cooking-fish/">cook your filets in a healthy way</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Fish may help prevent a slew of health conditions</strong></h3>

<p>As Sass explains, the omega-3s in fatty fish help reduce inflammation in the body, regulate blood pressure, and lower the risk of many conditions like diabetes, <a href="http://www.health.com/ibs">irritable bowel syndrome</a>, arthritis, asthma, and even some cancers. Convinced yet?</p>

    <![CDATA[Are bugs the new beef? Researchers have found that insects can provide just as much iron, magnesium, and other nutrients as red meat.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Think nothing can take the place of a juicy, perfectly cooked burger? Try a plate of fried grasshoppers.</p>

<p>Okay, so they won&#39;t exactly taste the same&mdash;and it may be tough to even stomach the thought of munching&nbsp;on bugs. But experts say that nutritionally speaking, they&rsquo;re a good substitute for beef, and may be a valuable food source of the future.</p>

<p>The idea of eating insects isn&rsquo;t new. They&rsquo;ve long been included in traditional diets of cultures around the world, and a 2013 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations noted that more than <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3253e/i3253e.pdf">1,900 insect species</a> have been documented as food sources globally.</p>

<p>Americans aren&rsquo;t so keen on consuming the critters, but bugs <em>have</em> crept into some Western food products in recent years. Cricket flour, for example, has become a popular ingredient in the high-protein, low-carb <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/pros-cons-paleo-diet">Paleo diet</a>. (One tester&#39;s&nbsp;verdict on <a href="http://news.health.com/2016/05/17/we-tried-cricket-chocolate-chip-cookies-so-you-dont-have-to/">crickets in chocolate chip cookies</a>? Tastes like walnuts!)</p>

<p>Insects have also been touted as a more sustainable alternative to eating meat and fish, especially as the global population grows. The process of <a href="http://news.health.com/2013/02/01/is-healthy-food-ethical/">raising and transporting animals</a> as food sources&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s cattle, pork, chicken, or farmed fish&mdash;produces greenhouse gases, uses water and other resources, and contributes to pollution.</p>

<p>There are surely more insects on Earth than there are fish in the sea or livestock on land. And it&rsquo;s well known that insects are high in <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20855303,00.html">protein</a>, but until now, their use as a good source of other nutrients has been unknown.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20786451,00.html">Everything You Need to Know About the Paleo Diet</a></strong></p>

<p>So researchers from Kings College London and Ningbo University in China set out to measure the nutrient content of various insects, to see if they really could contribute to a well-rounded meal, and measure up to Western staples like <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/grass-fed-beef-tips">beef</a>. The&nbsp;results were published this week in the <em>Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry</em>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The study authors were particularly concerned with <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/iron-rich-food">iron</a> concentration in insects, since iron is an important nutrient that&rsquo;s often lacking in <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20773383,00.html">vegetarian diets</a>. Not absorbing enough iron from food or supplements can lead to anemia, cognitive problems, weakened immunity, <a href="http://www.health.com/pregnancy">pregnancy</a> complications, and other health issues.</p>

<p>Using a lab model to mimic human digestion, the researchers analyzed the mineral content of <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b03286">grasshoppers, crickets, mealworms, and buffalo worms</a>&nbsp;(oy)&mdash;along with a sample of sirloin beef&mdash;and estimated how much of each nutrient would likely be absorbed if eaten.</p>

<p>The insects had varying levels of different nutrients.&nbsp;Crickets, for example, had the highest levels of iron, <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20845429,00.html">calcium</a>, and manganese. And, in fact, iron solubility (a characteristic that allows a mineral to be taken up and used by the body) was significantly higher in the insect samples than in the beef.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers, crickets, and mealworms also had higher concentrations of chemically available calcium, copper, zinc, and <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20914173,00.html">magnesium</a>, when compared to the sirloin.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20718479,00.html">14 Best Vegan and Vegetarian Protein Sources</a></strong></p>

<p>The results support the idea that eating bugs could potentially help meet the nutritional needs of the world&rsquo;s growing population, the researchers concluded. &ldquo;Commonly consumed insect species could be excellent sources of bioavailable iron,&rdquo; they wrote, &ldquo;and could provide the platform for an alternative strategy for increased mineral intake in the diet of humans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still not 100% sold&mdash;but we&rsquo;ve likely got some time to get used to the idea of bug-burgers as the next big thing. And as one brave volunteer in our <a href="http://news.health.com/2016/01/01/9-paleo-snacks-you-can-eat-on-the-go/">cricket-flour protein bar taste test</a> put it, is it really more gross than eating, say, a hot dog?</p>

<p>When you&nbsp;look at it that way, a little creepy-crawler crunch doesn&rsquo;t seem so bad.&nbsp;</p>

    <![CDATA[Researchers have zeroed in on an enzyme &mdash; found in natural foods like broccoli and cucumbers &mdash; that can slow some of the chronic conditions that come with age. So far the findings are limited to mice, but they&rsquo;re encouraged enough to start testing it in people
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>The&nbsp;quest for the Fountain of Youth&nbsp;is getting a boost from an international team of researchers who may have stumbled upon a compound that appears to make cells act younger than they are&mdash;at least in mice.</p>

<p>In a paper published in<em>&nbsp;Cell Metabolism</em>, researchers led by the Washington University School of Medicine reported that they found an agent that can balance out what happens in aging cells to essentially make them behave as they would in a younger mouse. That substance, as it turns out, is also found in a number of natural foods, including broccoli, cucumbers, cabbage and edamame.</p>

<p>The compound, called nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), is involved in producing another compound that is critical for energy metabolism. When they gave normal aging mice infusions of NMN, they made more of that energy-fueling compound and some of the biological problems associated with aging went away. The NMN-treated animals did not gain as much weight, they were able to convert food into energy more efficiently, their blood sugar was better&mdash;even their eyesight improved. The mice receiving NMN were also able to prevent some of the genetic changes associated with aging.</p>

<p>Most lab mice live just several years, so the researchers started the NMN treatments at five months, and continued them for a year. The study did not track whether the mice actually&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/3706701/cure-for-aging/">live longer</a>, but with lower rates of age-related disease, that&rsquo;s the assumption.</p>

<p>So can you load up on broccoli or cabbage and extend your life? &ldquo;If you do the math, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s impossible entirely but probably very difficult to get the whole amount [you need] simply from natural foods,&rdquo; says Dr. Shin-Ichiro Imai, professor of developmental biology and medicine at Washington University and senior author of the paper.</p>

<p>The results are encouraging enough that part of the team, based at Keio University in Tokyo, is launching an early study on people &mdash; using supplements of NMN in pill form. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that in humans and in rodents, we lose energy with age,&rdquo; says Imai. &ldquo;We are losing the enzyme NMN. But if we can bypass that process by adding NMN, we can make energy again. These results provide a very important foundation for the human studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The findings are also in line with other anti-aging compounds that have shown promise in animal studies, including things like the diabetes drug metformin, rapamycin and sirtuins, all of which are also involved in energy-making process. &ldquo;All of these pathways cross-talk with each other,&rdquo; says Imai. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the precise details of how, but they are communicating with each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hope is that the human studies will add provide even more information about how to keep cells young &mdash; and maybe halt, or at least hold off, the diseases that typically creep in as cells get older and lose their function.</p>

    <![CDATA[Should you add maca&nbsp;to&nbsp;your diet? An RD weighs in.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Whether or not you&#39;re obsessed with trying the latest uber-healthy food trends, you&#39;ve probably&nbsp;heard the buzz about&nbsp;maca. This pungent root veggie, cultivated in the Andes Mountains of Peru (and sometimes referred to as Peruvian ginseng), has been used traditionally&nbsp;for its nutritional and presumed medicinal qualities&nbsp;for thousands of years. Now, maca&nbsp;is&nbsp;popping up on supermarket shelves, and in energy bars, supplements, and smoothies. But before you add it to your diet, here are four things to keep in mind:</p>

<h3><strong>Maca is thought to have many perks</strong></h3>

<p>It&#39;s been heralded as a &quot;superfood&quot; because it contains key nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It&#39;s also long been believed to&nbsp;improve fertility, boost libido, sharpen mental focus and memory, enhance endurance, reduce the <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/555.html">symptoms of menopause, and more</a>. But there is limited research available to back up these claims.&nbsp;One recent Korean review of previous research found that maca&nbsp;improved&nbsp;sperm motility and semen quality in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27621241">infertile men</a>. And a very small study on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18784609">postmenopausal women</a>&nbsp;suggested that maca&nbsp;may enhance&nbsp;sexual desire.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>There are some safety concerns</strong></h3>

<p>Maca is taken&nbsp;as a natural treatment for <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/555.html">hormone imbalances</a>. But the fact that it may&nbsp;affect&nbsp;hormones could be a concern for some women. Many health professionals, including myself, advise women with hormone-sensitive conditions such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and certain cancers to avoid maca. Women who are&nbsp;pregnant or breastfeeding are also encouraged to steer clear of the root.</p>

<p>And though maca isn&#39;t labeled as a stimulant, many of my clients suspect that&nbsp;it triggered side effects like insomnia, racing heart rate, and stomach aches. If you&rsquo;re generally sensitive to stimulants like coffee, or you have <a href="http://www.health.com/ibs">irritable bowl syndrome</a> (IBS) or <a href="http://www.health.com/gerd">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> (GERD), pay attention to your body&#39;s response should you decide to give maca a try.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/clean-eating">What is Clean Eating?</a></strong></p>

<h3><strong>It comes in&nbsp;powdered form</strong></h3>

<p>You may be able to find fresh maca at a market in Peru, but not in the United States. Exporting the root whole is illegal. You&#39;ll find it here as a powder, in capsules, or in products like <a data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Chocolate-Maca-High-Protein/dp/B01J8D5JK0/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477068642&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=amrita%2Bchocolate%2Bmaca&amp;th=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Chocolate-Maca-High-Protein/dp/B01J8D5JK0/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477068642&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=amrita%2Bchocolate%2Bmaca&amp;th=1" target="_blank">Amrita&rsquo;s</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Chocolate-Maca-High-Protein/dp/B01J8D5JK0/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477068642&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=amrita%2Bchocolate%2Bmaca&amp;th=1"> Chocolate Maca</a>&nbsp;bar or <a data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Navitas-Naturals-Organic-Superfood-Cashews/dp/B00UEXWSZI/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477068705&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=navitas+maca+cashews" href="https://www.amazon.com/Navitas-Naturals-Organic-Superfood-Cashews/dp/B00UEXWSZI/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477068705&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=navitas+maca+cashews" target="_blank">Navitas&rsquo;</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navitas-Naturals-Organic-Superfood-Cashews/dp/B00UEXWSZI/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477068705&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=navitas+maca+cashews"> Maca Maple Cashews</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>It&rsquo;s simple to add maca to your diet</strong></h3>

<p>You can stir it&nbsp;into a pressed juice, whip it into a smoothie, or fold it into oatmeal, Greek yogurt, or pancake mix. It has a nutty flavor&nbsp;with a hint of butterscotch. And since there&#39;s more than one type, you can change things up by alternating the black, red, yellow, and&nbsp;blended varieties. Red maca, for example, is supposed to have the mildest flavor and provide the most health perks.</p>

<p>Just remember, a little goes a long way. So you might want to start with just a quarter to half a teaspoon. But even if maca becomes a part of your daily routine, I generally advise my clients to have no more than one teaspoon per day. And if it doesn&#39;t agree with&nbsp;you, don&#39;t sweat it. There are plenty of ways to&nbsp;upgrade your meals with other <a data-mce-href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20964992,00.html" href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20964992,00.html">superfood add-ins</a>.</p>

    <![CDATA[Most Americans don&#39;t get enough of this important nutrient. Pairing veggies with healthy&nbsp;fats can help.&nbsp;
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Vitamin E has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help keep our immune and circulatory systems running smoothly&mdash;but, unfortunately, 90 percent of Americans don&rsquo;t get the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/nutrients-you-need">recommended 15 milligrams a day</a>. Now, a new study suggests a tasty way to get more E into your day: The next time you enjoy a colorful salad, put an egg on it.</p>

<p>A few eggs, that is: Purdue University researchers found that when study volunteers ate salads with three cooked eggs, they&nbsp;<a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=27655756" target="_blank">absorbed 4.5 to 7.5 times more Vitamin E</a>&nbsp;from the accompanying vegetables than when they ate egg-free greens.</p>

<p>Vitamin E is fat-soluble, which means it is absorbed by the body along with dietary fats, like oils, seeds, and nuts. It&rsquo;s present in vegetables, but the body can&rsquo;t absorb it well&mdash;or put it to good use&mdash;if those veggies are eaten alone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/asparagus-health-benefits/aparagus-olive-oil-vitamin-e">A little olive oil</a>&nbsp;or an oil-based salad dressing can help<a href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/31/5-biggest-salad-mistakes-youre-making/">boost</a><a href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/31/5-biggest-salad-mistakes-youre-making/"> antioxidant absorption</a>&nbsp;from vegetables, previous studies have shown. Research also suggests that Vitamin E supplements are also better absorbed when taken with a fatty food or drink.</p>

<p>Now this study suggests another way get more Vitamin E out of salad greens and other raw vegetables. Plus, say the researchers, eggs themselves are rich in beneficial nutrients such as amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and B vitamins.</p>

<p>&quot;This study is novel because we measured the absorption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-10/pu-ste102516.php">Vitamin E from real foods,</a>&nbsp;rather than supplements, which contain mega-dose amounts of Vitamin E,&quot; said Jung Eun Kim, PhD, a researcher in Purdue&#39;s nutrition science department, in a press release. The findings also highlight how one food can improve the nutritional value of another when they&rsquo;re consumed together, the authors say.</p>

<p>The study, which was supported by the American Egg Board and the National Institutes of Health, involved 16 male volunteers who were fed three raw-vegetable salads, each a week apart. One contained no eggs, one an egg and a half, and one three eggs. Each salad was also served with 3 grams of canola oil.</p>

<p>Researchers analyzed blood samples from the volunteers after each salad was consumed, and found that absorption of two forms of Vitamin E&mdash;alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol&mdash;was 7.5 and 4.5 times greater, respectively, in those who ate three eggs compared to those who ate none. (That&#39;s not counting the small amount of Vitamin E found in eggs themselves.) There was no statistically significant absorption improvement for those who ate the smaller egg portion, suggesting that three whole eggs may be needed in order to truly reap such benefits.</p>

<p>The study was published this week in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Nutrition</em>. In 2015, the same research team conducted a similar study that found that carotenoids&mdash;another family of fat-soluble vitamins&mdash;were&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2015/04/02/add-eggs-to-your-salad-for-a-big-nutrition-boost/">also better absorbed</a>&nbsp;when salad was eaten with eggs. Scrambled eggs were used in both studies, but the researchers say hard-boiled or any other cooked preparation will do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/things-cooks-know-eggs">Speaking of eggs</a>, the &ldquo;incredible edible&rdquo; used to have quite a bad rap as a food high in dietary cholesterol. But recent research has found that cholesterol from food&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2015/02/20/how-the-nations-nutrition-panel-thinks-you-should-be-eating/" target="_blank">doesn&rsquo;t necessarily raise levels</a>&nbsp;in the body or contribute to cardiovascular disease. Today, most nutrition experts agree that&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2016/02/17/cholesterol-in-eggs-may-not-hurt-heart-health-study/" target="_blank">eating eggs in moderation</a>&nbsp;is safe and healthy for many people, yolks and all.</p>

<p>&quot;For healthy people who do not have high cholesterol and are not at risk for heart disease, having more than one whole egg per day is probably fine,&quot; says&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/author/cynthia-sass/" target="_blank">Cynthia Sass, RD</a>, author of&nbsp;<em>Slim Down Now</em>. However, Sass still recommends getting most of your daily fat from plant-based sources high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and extra-virgin olive oil.</p>

<p>Egg yolks contain about 3 grams of protein and 4 to 5 grams of fat each, while egg whites contain about 3 1/2 grams of protein and no fat. &quot;To reap the benefits of the yolk, while still boosting your total protein intake and making room for healthy plant-based fats, I generally recommend combining one whole egg with three whites, whether it&#39;s in a salad or an omelet, and adding a MUFA-rich fat source, like avocado, or EVOO,&quot; Sass told RealSimple.com.</p>

<p>&quot;One takeaway is not to skimp on fat in meals with veggies,&quot; she adds, &quot;whether it comes from whole eggs, or a combination of whole egg and healthy plant-based fat.&quot; Those plant-based sources should also boost the absorption of antioxidants and other fat-soluble nutrients, she points out (and many of them are good sources of Vitamin E themselves), so it&#39;s a win-win.</p>

    <![CDATA[Eat your yolks, folks
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Scan the &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; section of a brunch menu and there you&rsquo;ll find it: the world&rsquo;s saddest order, the egg white omelet. This time will be different, you think, these things aren&rsquo;t so bad, but then you stare down at the flat, pale pancake of liquid protein and think to yourself: W<em>hy do I do this to myself</em>?</p>

<p>You do it because you were told to. We all were. Until just recently, experts warned that&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/3705734/cholesterol-dietary-guidelines/?iid=sr-link4">dietary cholesterol</a>&nbsp;causes spikes in blood cholesterol, which in turn clogs arteries and hurts the heart. Cholesterol is found in the yellows, not the whites, so down the drain went the yolks.</p>

<p>Left behind are a wobbly mix of water, protein, some vitamins and little else. These whites are also sold in one-ingredient cartons, pasteurized so they can be eaten raw. (That&rsquo;s not the case for shell egg substitutes, like Egg Beaters Original, which come with egg whites but cut out cholesterol by mimicking the yolk with natural flavor and color, vegetable gums, maltodextrin and many other added ingredients.)</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s good reason not to fear the yolks. Scientific research has vindicated dietary cholesterol, finding that eating cholesterol has no real impact on cholesterol metabolism. That is,&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/3450058/should-i-eat-eggs/?iid=sr-link1">eating foods high in </a><a href="http://time.com/3450058/should-i-eat-eggs/?iid=sr-link1">cholesterol</a>&nbsp;does not mean you&rsquo;ll develop high cholesterol. Some evidence suggests that eggs might even be beneficial for cholesterol by raising levels of HDL cholesterol, the &ldquo;good&rdquo; cholesterol that&rsquo;s linked to a lower risk of heart disease.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4225819/eggs-nutrition-egg-yolk/?iid=sr-link1">Egg yolks</a>&nbsp;contain a vibrant mix of saturated and unsaturated fat&mdash;another nutrient that, when it comes from a healthy whole food source, is&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/3702058/dietary-guidelines-fat-wrong/">unfairly slandered</a>. Yolks have a good helping of vitamin E, one of the nutrients Americans eat too little of. But the real case for egg yolks can be made by their abundance of carotenoids, nutrients in plants and animal fats that give things like egg yolks (and even autumn leaves) their yellow color. Egg yolks are rich in the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which help eye health and protect against inflammation.</p>

<p>Sure, you can find carotenoids in more virtuous places, like fruits and vegetables. But egg yolks have an edge. Carotenoids need to be eaten with fat in order for the body to more fully absorb them, and a whole egg is the total package. Eat them, and you&rsquo;ll get more of these nutrients&mdash;not just from the eggs, but from the stuff you eat it with, too. Two large eggs provide 143 calories, 13 grams of protein and almost 10 grams of fat.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/3763004/eggs-raw-vegetables-carotenoid-absorption-nutritional-benefits/?iid=sr-link2">study</a>&nbsp;last year found that when people ate eggs on a raw vegetable salad, their bodies absorbed about 9 times the carotenoids, including lutein and zeaxanthin from the eggs and alpha carotene, beta carotene and lycopene from the veggies. A new one from the same authors found the same effect on vitamin E absorption as well.</p>

<p>Americans are&nbsp;<a href="http://labs.time.com/story/heres-how-americans-are-failing-to-meet-dietary-guidelines/?iid=sr-link2">notoriously bad</a>&nbsp;at eating vegetables; a full 87% of them eat less than the recommended amount. If they can wring more nutrients from those they do eat by adding an egg, yolks could do a lot of good, says Purdue University nutrition researcher and study author Jung Eun Kim. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fat in egg white, so you are not going to observe the same effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So next time you crack open an egg, don&rsquo;t let the fatty, cholesterol-choked yolk slip away. Mix it in for good texture&mdash;and even better health.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <![CDATA[If you&rsquo;re considering trying the Paleo diet&mdash;and when so many people claim to experience dramatic weight loss and health improvements on the diet, it&rsquo;s understandable why you would&mdash;watch this video. Health&rsquo;s contributing editor and registered dietician Cynthia Sass weighs in on the polarizing caveman diet.

The Paelo diet emphasizes protein and vegetable-rich meals, and cuts out all refined sugars and bread products. She finds that while the diet offers plenty health benefits, there are a couple of foods on the Paleo no-no list that she would recommend incorporating into your meals for a balanced diet. Watch the video to see which ones.

    <![CDATA[A new study challenges the popular health advice.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to drinking water, more is always better...&nbsp;right? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>Despite being told for years that we should all be gulping down eight 8-ounce glasses a day, the actual amount of fluids we need varies from person to person. Now, a new study has revealed what happens in our brains, and our bodies, when we&rsquo;ve reached our hydration limit&mdash;and why it might be dangerous to ignore the feeling that you&rsquo;ve had enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The research, published in the&nbsp;<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States of America</em>, found that people&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/05/1613929113.abstract">had a harder time </a><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/05/1613929113.abstract">swallowing</a>after consuming excess amounts of water. This appears to be a protective response to prevent over-drinking, the authors say, which can lead to a potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia, also known as water toxicity.</p>

<p>For the study, the researchers put 20 people in functional MRI (fMRI) scanners and asked them to rate the effort level required to swallow small amounts of water under two different conditions&mdash;after exercising, when they were thirsty; and later, after they&rsquo;d already drank about a liter of water.</p>

<p>The participants rated swallowing in the second scenario three times more difficult than in the first. This was true for both plain water and for water sweetened with sugar.</p>

<p>This showed that they had to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newswise.com/articles/study-challenges-idea-of-mandatory-water-intake">&ldquo;overcome some sort of resistance,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;co-author Michael Farrell, Ph.D., associate professor at Monash University in Australia, said in a press release. &ldquo;This was compatible with our notion that the swallowing reflex becomes inhibited once enough water has been drunk.&quot;</p>

<p>This &ldquo;swallowing inhibition&rdquo; seems to help regulate water intake and maintain fluid levels in the human body, the authors wrote, but it&rsquo;s not foolproof. After all, the participants were still able to swallow, even though it was harder than usual.</p>

<p>In fact, fMRI scans showed that the right prefrontal areas of participants&rsquo; brains were much more active when they were trying to swallow after overdrinking&mdash;suggesting that the frontal cortex steps in to override the inhibition and allow swallowing on command.</p>

<p>When the body is flooded with water, sodium levels can become abnormally low&mdash;a condition called&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2015/07/09/is-it-possible-to-drink-too-much-water/" target="_blank">hyponatremia</a>&nbsp;that can lead to lethargy, nausea, seizures, and even death. People who lose a lot of sodium through sweat and don&rsquo;t replenish their levels (with salt or an electrolyte beverage) are especially at risk.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the study participants hadn&rsquo;t consumed huge amounts of water, and weren&rsquo;t in any actual danger. But there are times when people may have more water than is safe, say the authors, and may disregard signals from their brains to stop drinking.</p>

<p>&quot;There have been cases when&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2016/03/09/for-ironman-athletes-study-shows-danger-of-too-much-water/">athletes in marathons</a>&nbsp;were told to load up with water and died, in certain circumstances, because they slavishly followed these recommendations and drank far in excess of need,&quot; Farrell said.</p>

<p>Of course, not drinking&nbsp;<em>enough</em>&nbsp;water is also a common problem in athletes, and in non-athletes as well. Mild dehydration may not lead directly to serious health problems, but it has been linked to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20924876,00.html#it-makes-you-tired--0">low energy levels</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20924876,00.html#it-can-give-you-a-headache-0">headaches</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20924876,00.html#it-constipates-you--0">constipation</a>, and even&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2016/07/12/drink-water-stay-slimmer/">obesity</a>.</p>

<p>Farrell pointed out that elderly people, especially often don&rsquo;t drink enough water and should watch their intake of fluids.</p>

<p>So how much fluid should you get every day? The Institute of Medicine recommends that men aim for 125 ounces and women aim for 91 ounces a day, but that includes water from foods and other beverages&mdash;like juice, tea, and yes, even coffee&mdash;as well.&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2015/09/16/the-amount-of-water-you-actually-need-per-day/">That number can also vary</a>&nbsp;based on your age, weight, other health conditions, and how active (and how sweaty) you are.</p>

<p>In short, says Farrell, don&rsquo;t try to force anything. &ldquo;Just drink according to thirst rather than an elaborate schedule,&rdquo; he said. &quot;If we just do what our body demands us to we&#39;ll probably get it right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <![CDATA[Short answer: Yes, there are traces of weed killer in many types of oatmeal. But can they hurt you? That question is more difficult to answer.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;FDA tests confirm oatmeal, baby foods contain residues of Monsanto weed killer,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/fda-tests-confirm-oatmeal_b_12252824.html">cried a headline</a> from the Huffington Post last month. The article&mdash;a republished press release from the non-profit watchdog group U.S. Right to Know&mdash;cited a study that revealed <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/fda-tests-confirm-oatmeal_b_12252824.html">traces of glyphosate</a>, the main ingredient in the pesticide Round-Up, in several oat-based products.</p>

<p>ThisAre There Really Pesticides in Your Oatmeal?&nbsp;sounds pretty scary, especially for anyone who eats oats regularly. (At <em>Health</em>, that&rsquo;s a lot of us&mdash;the&nbsp;whole grain lowers cholesterol, burns fat, and fills you up with fiber, folate, and potassium.) We couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder: Does this mean we should ditch our go-to morning meal?</p>

<p>We dug a little deeper, and here&rsquo;s what we found out.</p>

<p>First, the bad news: It&rsquo;s true that an FDA chemist found small amounts of glyphosate in several types of oat cereals.&nbsp;In his presentation at the&nbsp;North American Chemical Residue Workshop in July, Narong Chamkasem highlighted the amounts found in <a href="http://www.nacrw.org/2016/presentations/O-27.pdf">samples of instant oatmeal</a> (maple brown sugar, cinnamon spice, peach and cream), non-instant steel cut oats, and infant oat cereal (plain, banana, and banana strawberry). These quantities ranged from 0.3 to 1.67 parts per million.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20934643,00.html">12 Germs That Cause Food Poisoning</a></strong></p>

<p>Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world, and is used in hundreds of weed-killing products. Many health and agricultural&nbsp;experts say that humans <a href="http://news.health.com/2015/08/19/genetically-modified-foods-herbicides-and-human-safety/">don&rsquo;t absorb glyphosate</a> in the same way they do harmful chemicals like DDT, so it&rsquo;s safe in low quantities&mdash;like what&rsquo;s left on sprayed crops after they&rsquo;re harvested, cleaned, and prepared for food sales.</p>

<p>In 2015, however, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a <a href="http://news.health.com/2015/03/23/pesticides-used-in-pet-collars-and-home-insect-and-weed-killer-sprays-connected-to-cancer/">&ldquo;probably human carcinogen&rdquo;</a> after studies linked it to non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. Earlier this year, the FDA announced that it would begin <a href="http://time.com/4227500/fda-glyphosate-testing/">testing for glyphosate</a> in four widely used crops: soybeans, corn, milk, and eggs.</p>

<p>Now, the better news: The tolerable limit for glyphosate in the United States, set by the Environmental Protection Agency, is 30 ppm. The quantities found in the research presented in July, then, were well below that limit. (They were below Europe&rsquo;s stricter limit of 20 ppm, as well.)</p>

<p>The oatmeal testing was done as part of an independent research project, an FDA spokesperson tells <em>Health</em>, and the results have not been published or peer-reviewed. Preliminary findings of the FDA&rsquo;s other product testing have found no glyphosate residues over the allowable limit either, says the Agency, although the results are still being verified.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brand names were not included in the labeling of these samples. But earlier this year, a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/business/quaker-oats-100-natural-claim-questioned-in-lawsuit.html?_r=0">lawsuit was filed against Quaker Oats</a> over claims that products were &ldquo;100% natural,&rdquo; after independent tests found glyphosate, at a level of 1.18 ppm, in a sample of its Quick 1-Minute Oatmeal.</p>

<p>On Quaker Oats&rsquo; website, the company says it <a href="http://www.quakeroats.com/about-quaker-oats/content/quaker-faq.aspx">does not add glyphosate</a> during any part of the milling process, but that it is commonly used by farmers who apply it pre-harvest. &ldquo;Once the oats are transported to us,&rdquo; an FAQ page states, &ldquo;we put them through our rigorous process that thoroughly cleanses them (de-hulled, cleaned, roasted and flaked).&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any levels of glyphosate that may remain are trace amounts and significantly below any limits which have been set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as safe for human consumption,&rdquo; the FAQ continues. &ldquo;The typical consumer would, on average, have to consume approximately 1,000 bowls of oatmeal a day to even come close the safe limit set by the US government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So what does all this mean? Unfortunately, nothing definitive. It&rsquo;s clear that many conventionally farmed crops that we eat in America are sprayed with glyphosate before harvesting, but so far no studies have found levels high enough to raise red flags, at least not officially.</p>

<p>Want to play it safe? Avoiding oats has its downsides, too: The hearty whole grains are rich in fiber and important nutrients, and they&rsquo;ve long been touted as a <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20307113,00.html">natural way to lower cholesterol</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, a study out last week found that oat consumption doesn&rsquo;t just help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, but that it also brings down <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161007085247.htm">two other markers of cardiovascular risk</a>&mdash;non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol minus HDL) and apolipoprotein B, a protein that carries bad cholesterol through the blood.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to give up your regular breakfast bowl but you&rsquo;re concerned about pesticide levels, there is one thing you can do: Choose organic oats, says <em>Health</em> contributing nutrition editor Cynthia Sass, RD.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20471167,00.html">11 Foods You Should Buy Organic</a></strong></p>

<p>Eating organic can help you lower your exposure to even trace amounts of pesticides, says Sass, particularly for foods you eat daily. (It&rsquo;s worth noting that in the most recent FDA oatmeal findings, the organic products tested&mdash;from brands such as <a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/blog/featured-articles/glyphosate/">Bob&rsquo;s Red Mill</a>, 365 Whole Foods, Sprout, and Nature Path&mdash;had no detectable levels of pesticides.)</p>

<p>Organic foods are pricier than conventionally grown ones, but they don&rsquo;t have to break the bank, says Sass. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re on a budget, look for store-brand organic products,&rdquo; she recommends. &ldquo;And you can save on&nbsp;name brand&nbsp;organic manufacturers by looking for&nbsp;printable coupons on their web sites, or on retailer sites.&rdquo; She also suggests checking the bulk section at your supermarket, where items tend to cost less per serving, for organic options.</p>

    <![CDATA[No need to count calories. Healthy eating starts with ingredients, not numbers.&nbsp;
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Vegan? High-fat? <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/gluten-free-diets">Gluten-free</a>? So many of my clients complain about how difficult it is to keep up with what&#39;s healthy these days<em>, </em>especially when it comes to buying anything <a href="http://www.health.com/food/gluten-free-desserts">packaged</a>. Most aren&rsquo;t sure what to look out for on nutrition labels, and are often surprised when I give the thumbs-down to a product they thought was a smart purchase.</p>

<p>To help with this struggle, I advise my clients to keep it simple when it comes to deciding if a product deserves a place in their <a href="http://www.health.com/food/best-trader-joes-products">grocery cart</a>. Here&rsquo;s my easy-to-remember three-step strategy for choosing and enjoying the best packaged foods.</p>

<h3><strong>Look at the ingredients first</strong></h3>

<p>In my opinion, the most important thing to look for is <a href="http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20837066,00.html">clean</a>, whole-food ingredients. In other words, if a product&rsquo;s ingredient list reads like a recipe you could make in your own kitchen, I consider it &ldquo;homemade for you,&rdquo; and generally a nutritious bet. Meanwhile, a&nbsp;product that is low in carbs, contains fewer calories, or more <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/types-of-fiber">fiber</a>&mdash;all things that many people equate with &quot;healthy&quot;&mdash;may actually be heavily processed and contain unwanted additives that serve no purpose in the body. So first and foremost, be sure to choose quality products based on ingredients, not marketing claims and numbers.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/what-to-buy-at-whole-foods">The Best Things to Buy at Whole Foods, According to Expert Foodies</a></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Categorize your foods</strong></h3>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve purchased a clean, nutritious product, figure out what food group it fits into. A&nbsp;bag of frozen broccoli florets, for example,&nbsp;counts as a veggie, while canned wild salmon as a protein, pre-made <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/09/12/5-amazing-powers-of-avocado/?hootPostID=189e6b01a97850338f4b6fc681e4b435" href="http://www.health.com/food/guacamole-recipes" target="_blank">guacamole</a> as a good fat, and frozen, pre-cooked <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20844296,00.html">quinoa</a> as a starch. Once you know where a food fits, you&rsquo;ll be able to build it into a healthy meal or snack. That&rsquo;s important, because even if a food is very healthy, eating it in excess can interfere with energy, weight management, blood sugar regulation, and other health goals. I&#39;ve had clients tell me they feel okay about eating an entire bag of popcorn in one sitting because it&#39;s&nbsp;low in calories. But here&#39;s what they didn&#39;t realize: the calories are low per serving, but an entire bag of popcorn packs the carbs and fat of&nbsp;four slices of bread and nearly four tablespoons of oil.</p>

<h3><strong>Customize your portions</strong></h3>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in&nbsp;counting calories or grams. Instead, I focus on simple meal-building strategies based on portions.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone should include veggies, lean protein, good fat, and wholesome carbs in their meals, but the amounts vary depending on height, age, sex, and physical activity level. A tall man needs larger portions than a petite woman, and&nbsp;a person who goes for a 5-mile run every day&nbsp;requires more food than someone who rarely works out.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day">This is How Much Protein You Really Need to Eat in a Day</a></strong></p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve purchased a healthy pasta, like <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/11/13/8-awesome-whole-grains-youre-not-eating/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/11/13/8-awesome-whole-grains-youre-not-eating/" target="_blank">buckwheat</a> soba noodles, or penne made with brown rice or <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/04/03/keep-the-carbs-lose-the-pounds/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/04/03/keep-the-carbs-lose-the-pounds/" target="_blank">pulses</a>. If you&rsquo;re a petite or older woman who is going to be sitting in the hours after dinner, that pasta should be considered a&nbsp;meal accent, perhaps in a portion even smaller than the serving size stated on the&nbsp;package. A younger, taller man who is about to start the night shift of a physically demanding job, on the other hand, can afford to eat multiple pasta portions at dinner to meet his body&rsquo;s greater energy demands. In a nutshell, this approach really comes down to balance and customization.</p>

<p>Next&nbsp;time you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed at the grocery store, just remember to choose high quality,&nbsp;clean ingredient&nbsp;products, understand how they fit into your diet, and tailor your portions to your body&rsquo;s needs. If you follow these three steps you don&rsquo;t need to get caught up in comparing calorie counts, grams of carbs and fat, or percentages. And you won&rsquo;t fall into the trap of overeating your healthy buys.</p>

    <![CDATA[The company&#39;s&nbsp;food and drink products are marketed as all the nutrients you need.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>The food of the future seems to have hit a bit of a roadblock. Soylent, a brand of bioengineered meal-replacement products that boasts &ldquo;all of the elements of a healthy diet,&rdquo; announced yesterday that its newest offering&mdash;a food bar that launched in August&mdash;is making people sick.</p>

<p>Consumers recently began posting concerns on the company&rsquo;s forum, citing episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, and becoming &ldquo;violently ill&rdquo; after consuming the bars. <em><a href="http://www.eater.com/2016/10/7/13205788/soylent-food-bars-making-people-sick">Eater</a></em> and other media sites reported the news last week, noting that similar threads had also been reported on Reddit.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Soylent addressed the issue in a blog post. The company instructed consumers to <a href="http://blog.soylent.com/post/151720602057/update-on-soylent-bar">throw away any bars</a> in their possession, and said that it was temporarily halting sales and shipping of the product.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has recently come to our attention that a small number of our customers have experienced gastrointestinal issues after consuming Soylent Bars,&rdquo; the blog post states. The company said it has not yet identified a cause, and that refunds will be offered to customers via email.</p>

<p>Soylent&rsquo;s bars were introduced as a new alternative to the company&rsquo;s flagship product, Soylent Powder. The powder, which contains a patented blend of soy protein, algae oil, beet sugar, and other vitamins and nutrients, can be mixed with water &ldquo;to create a nutritionally balanced meal that will satisfy you for hours,&rdquo; according to the company&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/vegan-diet-nutrition">How to Go Vegan and Still Get All Your Nutrients</a></strong></p>

<p>The company also sells a bottled, pre-mixed drink called <a href="http://time.com/3982414/soylent-bottles/">Soylent 2.0</a>, and a Soylent-coffee blend called Coffiest.</p>

<p>Since the brand&rsquo;s launch in 2013, it&rsquo;s received considerable attention for its unique&mdash;and somewhat controversial&mdash;marketing approach. Soylent claims to contain 100% of essential vitamins and minerals, and just the right balance of protein, fat, fiber, and other nutrients that humans need to survive and thrive.</p>

<p>The formula was created by four entrepreneurs working for startups and &ldquo;living off a diet of <a href="https://www.soylent.com/about/">frozen corn dogs and ramen</a>&rdquo; who were eager for a healthy yet convenient alternative. In a 2013 interview with <em>Time</em>, co-founder Rob&nbsp;Rhinehart&nbsp;said he <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/06/10/soylent-is-the-food-of-the-future-really-a-nutrition-solution/">lived exclusively off Soylent</a>, with the exception of a few weekend meals.</p>

<p>Some people enjoy cooking and preparing real meals, he said&mdash;but for those who don&rsquo;t, Soylent can be a nutritious, time-saving, and affordable alternative.</p>

<p>Many nutritionists, however, have remained less than convinced. &ldquo;When it comes to meals or snacks, you really shouldn&rsquo;t mess with Mother Nature,&rdquo; says registered dietitian Joan Salge Blake, clinical associate professor at Boston University. &ldquo;These products may have the basic nutrients listed in a textbook, but they&rsquo;re likely missing other compounds that, working in conjunction, could be your ticket to longevity, disease prevention, and overall better health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soylent takes its name from the 1966 science-fiction novel <em>Make Room! Make Room!</em>, in which a soy- and lentil-based product of the same name is used to feed a massively growing global population. (The movie <em>Soylent Green</em> was loosely based on this book, but with a disturbing twist: In this version, the product&rsquo;s secret ingredient turned out to be people.)</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/pea-protein">Pea Protein: The Trendy Vegan Ingredient That Helps Keep You Full</a></strong></p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s new caramel-flavored bar is marketed as a lighter, more portable form of Soylent, with 250 calories and 12.5% of &ldquo;everything your body needs.&rdquo; In other words, a person on a 2,000-calorie diet could eat 12 bars&mdash;or a combination of bars and other Soylent products&mdash;to fulfill all of their daily calorie and nutrient requirements.</p>

<p>The product&rsquo;s fine print notes that &ldquo;while not intended to replace every meal, Soylent can replace any meal.&rdquo; Because individuals&rsquo; nutritional needs vary, however, children and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or may become pregnant are cautioned to consult their doctor before eating.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unknown why the new bars are causing customers to become ill&mdash;but even without these recent problems, Salge Blake says that relying heavily on them for your dietary needs may not be the smartest choice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first ingredient is soy protein and the second ingredient is corn syrup&mdash;a type of sugar,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Most Americans are eating too much added sugar, so we need to be more savvy when it comes to the food products we choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A peanut butter sandwich or a snack of fruit and nuts can be just as convenient as a prepackaged bar, she says, and contains other healthful ingredients with no added sugars. It can also be less expensive than eating Soylent bars, which retail for $24 per 12-pack.</p>

<p>Soylent&rsquo;s nutritional profile isn&rsquo;t the only thing that raises concern for Salge Blake. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re doing while we eat is just as important as what we&rsquo;re eating,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If you really don&rsquo;t have time to cook&mdash;or to even sit down and have real food&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;s time to start questioning your lifestyle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flavor and texture are important components of eating, she adds, and so is enjoying meals with friends and family. &ldquo;Taking some time to break bread together&mdash;especially if it&rsquo;s whole-grain bread&mdash;is good for you and for the people around you,&rdquo; she says.</p>

    <![CDATA[A new study suggests there&#39;s a downside to all that protein
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Eating a diet that&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/4131682/protein-longevity-paleo/">high in protein</a>&nbsp;is often recommended for people trying to lose weight, since&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/4386215/best-protein-foods/">high-protein foods</a>&nbsp;make people feel more full, preventing overeating. However, a new study suggests that while the diet may help people slim down, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily improve other health problems under the hood. (For more on that, see:&nbsp;<a href="http://time.com/4131682/protein-longevity-paleo/">How Much Protein Should I Eat Every Day</a>.)</p>

<p>In a small study, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis followed 34 postmenopausal women with obesity for about six months. The women were split into three groups: One group kept their diet the same, one group went on a calorie-restricted weight loss diet (with the daily recommended amount of protein), and another group went on the same diet but also increased their protein intake by about 150-250 calories. The researchers provided all the meals for the women, and besides the increased protein, the diets were virtually the same.</p>

<p>The study authors found that while both groups of women were able to lose about 10% of their body weight, the women who ate more protein experienced no changes in their insulin sensitivity&mdash;which is important for overall health.</p>

<p>Improved insulin sensitivity is important to cut down on a person&rsquo;s risk for type 2 diabetes&mdash;which is common in people with obesity. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons weight loss is recommended for better health in the first place. The women who lost weight without increasing the amount of protein they ate experienced a 25 to 30% improvement in insulin sensitivity. But the women who ate more protein experienced no change in their insulin sensitivity at all. &ldquo;We definitely expected a blunting of the effect, but to completely eliminate it was a little bit surprising,&rdquo; says lead study author Bettina Mittendorfer, a professor of medicine.</p>

<p>The number of people in the study, which was published Tuesday in the journal&nbsp;<em>Cell Reports</em>, is very small, but Mittendorfer says the report is not the first to raise skepticism about high-protein diets. &ldquo;There is a reported association from epidemiological studies between protein intake and an increased risk for type 2 diabetes,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>Mittendorfer and her fellow researchers plan to continue studying the issue to better understand why people who eat more protein did not experience the same metabolic benefits, and whether the type of protein a person consumes matters. For instance, does plant protein have different effects compared to animal protein? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tremendous effort to go through a 10% loss in body weight. To not see an improvement in one of these key factors is significant I think,&rdquo; says Mittendorfer.</p>

<p>Though the study is small and more research is needed to better understand the findings, Mittendorfer says she would advise people to be &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; about adopting a high-protein diet to lose weight. &ldquo;I think there is no reason to go for high protein intake during weight loss, based on our results,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason to do it, and potentially there is harm or lack of a benefit.&rdquo;</p>

    <![CDATA[The brand&#39;s veggie drinks are made with mainly apple and orange juice, the lawsuit says
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re a green juice drinker, you might&nbsp;want to take a look at what&rsquo;s really inside your favorite beverages. Along with leafy veggies like kale and spinach, there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;re also full of high-sugar fruit juice&mdash;and one advocacy group says consumers are being misled about their nutritional and caloric values.</p>

<div>
<article about="/health/nutrition-diet/naked-juice-lawsuit-cspi" id="node-490168" typeof="Document">
<section itemprop="articleBody">
<p>On Tuesday, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo, parent company of Naked Juice. A statement from the nonprofit group argues that the fruit-and veggie-based juices are advertised as &ldquo;predominantly containing high-value ingredients such as acai berry, blueberries, kale, and mango, when in fact the predominant ingredient in the product line is usually&nbsp;<a href="https://cspinet.org/news/pepsico%E2%80%99s-naked-juices-mislead-consumers-says-lawsuit-20161004">cheap, nutrient-poor apple juice</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CSPI also takes issue with the juices&rsquo; claims of &ldquo;no sugar added,&rdquo; which it says implies that they are low in sugar. In fact, the group points out, a 15-ounce bottle of Kale Blazer (whose first ingredient is orange juice) contains eight teaspoons of sugar. A 12-ounce can of Pepsi, in comparison, has 10 teaspoons.</p>

<p>The label should also be required to include the phrase &ldquo;not a low-calorie food,&rdquo; says the CSPI, or to refer consumers to the nutrition facts panel for more information about sugar.</p>

<p>Finally, the lawsuit implies that PepsiCo tricked consumers into buying Naked Juices by giving them misleading names and filling their labels with pictures of highly nutritious ingredients (like kale) but not of more prominent ingredients, such as apples and oranges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kale is the king of the garden,&rdquo; according to the text on the side of the bottle. &ldquo;And, when it&rsquo;s blended with cucumber, spinach, celery and a pinch of ginger, you get a royal roundtable of yum.&rdquo;&nbsp; Advertisements for the product on social media and elsewhere state that &ldquo;&hellip;you might actually live forever because kale has tons of antioxidants that combat aging,&rdquo; and that the drink is a way to &ldquo;pack more kale into your diet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consumers are paying higher prices for the healthful and expensive ingredients advertised on Naked labels,&rdquo; said CSPI litigation director Maia Kats.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not getting what they paid for.&rdquo; Other flavors mentioned in the legal filings include Green Machine and Very Berry.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs of the class-action lawsuit would not have purchased these beverages if they&rsquo;d been aware of their&nbsp;<em>true</em>&nbsp;nutritional profile, the lawsuit claims. It is seeking refunds for consumers, as well as an injunction to stop PepsiCo&rsquo;s marketing.</p>

<p>PepsiCo released a statement on Wednesday in response to the lawsuit, saying: &quot;There is nothing misleading about our Naked Juice products. &nbsp;Every bottle of Naked Juice clearly identifies the fruit and vegetables that are within. For example, the label on our Kale Blazer juice accurately indicates each bottle contains 5 3/4 Kale leaves.&quot; You can read it in its entirety&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pepsico.com/live/pressrelease/pepsico-statement-on-the-naked-juice-lawsuit" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how the case will play out; in 2013, Naked Juice settled another class-action lawsuit for its use of the term &ldquo;all natural&rdquo; on its labels, although it denied the term was misleading. CSPI has also sued other brands, including CocaCola&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/secretly-unhealthy-foods/page2">Vitaminwater</a>, over health claims made on their labels.</p>

<p>Regardless of the results, though, the news does bring an important issue to light: the fact that processed foods&mdash;even ones containing fruits and veggies&mdash;aren&rsquo;t always as they&nbsp;appear.</p>

<p>But does that make Naked Juice&nbsp;<em>unhealthy</em>, or mean&nbsp;that&nbsp;we should stop drinking it? Not necessarily, says nutritionist and exercise physiologist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.feliciastoler.com/">Felicia Stoler, RD</a>, author of&nbsp;<em>Living Skinny in Fat Genes,&nbsp;</em>who is not affiliated with PepsiCo or any other juice companies.</p>

<p>Yes, consumers should read nutrition labels and be aware of a drink&rsquo;s full list of ingredients, she says. But despite their high sugar content, she says, people could do a lot worse than a drink made of vegetables and fruit juice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be high in calories, but at least the Naked Juice also has vitamins and minerals,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.health.com/food/sugary-drinks-bad-soda">Compare that to a soda</a>, which has nothing except for calories. If somebody&rsquo;s on-the-go or they have a day when they haven&rsquo;t gotten any fruits and vegetables, these drinks can be a way to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/nutrition/juice-vs-smoothie">get some nutrition in</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some sugar from fruit juice isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, either, she says, especially for people who are physically active and consuming an appropriate amount of calories overall. &ldquo;Sugar equals carbohydrates equals energy equals fuel,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather somebody eat a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/should-your-family-eat-this-or-that/apple-juice-or-orange-juice">whole vegetable or a whole apple</a>, but drinking a green juice is certainly better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact that Naked Juices&rsquo; veggie drinks are predominantly orange- and apple-flavored don&rsquo;t bother her either. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about consumer taste,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If they really put 100-percent kale juice on the shelf, very few people would buy it. People don&rsquo;t like the taste of vegetables that much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The key, she says, is knowing what you&rsquo;re drinking&mdash;and making sure that it&rsquo;s just one component of an overall healthy, balanced eating plan. Don&rsquo;t guzzle fruit (or veggie) juices in excess; don&rsquo;t use them as your sole source of produce; and don&rsquo;t buy a product without&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/how-read-food-labels">reading the label</a>.</p>

<p>Keep those guidelines in mind, and the occasional green drink or berry blend can be a delicious part of your diet.&nbsp;</p>

    <![CDATA[End the skimpy-meal madness&mdash;this three-week breakfast makeover&nbsp;adds nutritional oomph to power up your busiest days.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Eating a balanced plate first thing gives you an energy surge to kick off your day and helps keep your hunger in check. &ldquo;What you eat for <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20668029,00.html">breakfast</a> sets the tone for the whole day,&rdquo; says Leah Kaufman, RD, a dietitian in New York City. This is how to make that starter meal healthy yet uncomplicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your action plan:&nbsp;Create a habit of eating something smart in the a.m. every day for three weeks by mixing and matching the strategies below. When assembling meals, follow this formula: a bit of protein along with a healthy carb and a good fat (like nuts or <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20395687,00.html">avocado</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/small_16_9/public/1473965640/Oats.jpeg?itok=LQpah2wc" /></h3>

<h3><strong>Strategy #1: Make prep-ahead moves</strong></h3>

<p>Spend time Sunday setting up several days&rsquo; worth of breakfasts. A few simple solutions:</p>

<p><strong>Go mini:</strong>&nbsp;Use a muffin tin to prepare mini egg frittatas; eat two per morning. (This <a href="http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20945343,00.html" target="_blank">Egg Frittata recipe</a>&nbsp;makes eight, enough for nearly the whole workweek.)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Make it in your sleep:</strong>&nbsp;Mix a big batch of <a href="http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20945356,00.html" target="_blank">overnight oats</a> or <a href="http://www.health.com/health/recipe/0,,50400000126381,00.html" target="_blank">chia pudding</a>. Both are yummy, nutrient-rich breakfast bowls.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bag smoothies:</strong>&nbsp;Grab plastic baggies and put 1 cup berries, half a banana, and 1 tablespoon flaxseed into each. Stash them in the freezer; when your alarm goes off, toss one serving into the blender with ice, almond milk and 1 tablespoon almond butter.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/small_16_9/public/1459875887/GettyImages-496389270.jpg?itok=zeZSINwI" /></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Strategy #2: Have an arsenal of&nbsp;5-minute meal ideas</strong></h3>

<p>No chance to make ahead? These eats can be ready in a flash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Follow the two-topping rule:</strong>&nbsp;Plain quick-cooking oatmeal is an easy way to get a hearty breakfast fast.&nbsp;Limit yourself to two add-ins, like berries and raw peanuts. One should always be a source of protein, but don&rsquo;t stick with just <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20585485,00.html">nuts</a>. Try one of Kaufman&rsquo;s creative oatmeal mix-ins: 1&frasl;2 cup low-fat cottage cheese or three egg whites.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pick PB:</strong>&nbsp;Peanut butter is a tasty protein source, perfect on whole-grain toast with a piece of fruit. In a real hurry? Make a peanut butter sandwich.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Think outside the yogurt cup:</strong>&nbsp;Have an unsweetened Greek yogurt and apply the two-topping rule (try <a href="http://news.health.com/2014/11/21/health-benefits-of-cinnamon/">cinnamon</a> and granola). Or pair the plain yogurt with an <a href="http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20957784,00.html">energy bar</a>. One of Kaufman&rsquo;s faves: Zing Bars ($32 for 12; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zing-Nutrition-Bar-Chocolate-Coconut-Box-1-76oz/dp/B0042MXRC0" target="_blank">amazon.com</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Enjoy dinner leftovers:</strong>&nbsp;&quot;A cold slice of vegetable <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20464374,00.html">pizza</a> tastes great at breakfast,&quot;&nbsp;says Ruth Frechman, RD, author of <em>The Food Is My Friend Diet.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Strategy #3: Master get-out-the-door hacks</strong></h3>

<p>When making (and sitting and eating) breakfast at home is absolutely not happening, try these on-the-go options.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stock up at your destination:</strong>&nbsp;Keep <a href="http://www.health.com/food/best-nut-butters">nut butter</a> and plain oatmeal packets in a desk drawer. Have an office fridge? Stash <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20754525,00.html">yogurts</a> and hard-boiled eggs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Swing by the supermarket:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;People forget that you can stop at a grocery store and only buy a <a href="http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20954606,00.html">banana</a> and a yogurt,&rdquo; says Abby Langer, RD, a dietitian in Toronto and the owner of Abby Langer Nutrition. &ldquo;You have more control than when you&rsquo;re limited to <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20630037,00.html">menu items at a drive-through</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Make a coffee&nbsp;shop pit stop:</strong>&nbsp;But order a healthy item that you would prepare in your own kitchen, says Kaufman&mdash;like a feta-and-egg-white wrap or a box of apple slices, nuts and cheese.&nbsp;</p>

    <![CDATA[Every half-teaspoon or so raises risk of premature death by 12 percent, study suggests]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Oct. 3, 2016 (HealthDay News) — Conventional wisdom says too much salt is bad because it can lead to high blood pressure.</p>

<p>And now a new 25-year study finds that salt—even just a bit—may increase your risk of premature death.</p> 

<p>The research found that if you normally have about 1.5 teaspoons of salt daily, adding just slightly less than a half teaspoon (1,000 milligrams) more a day can increase your odds of dying early by 12 percent. And, the risk continues to climb 12 percent for each 1,000 milligrams of salt you add to your daily diet.</p>

<p>There was a potential bit of good news from the study, however.</p>

<p>Cutting back on your salt consumption may extend your life. The study showed that restricting salt seemed to lower the risk of dying prematurely by 15 percent. However, this finding didn't reach statistical significance, the researchers said.</p>

<p>"Consuming lower levels of sodium, as advocated by the American Heart Association  and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, will lead to lower blood pressure, lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lower subsequent mortality," said lead researcher Nancy Cook. She's a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.</p>

<p>Specifically, Cook's team found that over 24 years, people who consumed less than 1 teaspoon (2,300 mg of salt a day) had a 25 percent lower risk of dying, compared with those who consumed almost 1.5 teaspoons (3,600 mg/day).</p>

<p>The American Heart Association (AHA) says that the average American consumes 3,400 mg of salt a day.</p>

<p>"Much of the sodium we consume is found in processed food," Cook said. "The FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] has now recommended a gradual reduction in sodium content in many such foods, which should lead to lower rates of hypertension as well as cardiovascular disease and deaths," she said.</p>

<p>The report was published Oct. 3 in the <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</i>.</p>

<p>The AHA currently recommends no more than 2,400 mg of salt daily. But, for optimal heart health, the AHA suggests no more than 1,500 mg of salt each day.</p>

<p>The link between salt intake and death has been controversial, Cook said. It seems it's accepted now that high salt can have adverse effects, "but whether very low sodium levels are beneficial is less well accepted," she said. </p>

<p>It's known that reducing salt helps lower blood pressure, but whether that translates to a reduction in heart disease and death is less clear, Cook said.</p>

<p>While this new study didn't prove cause and effect, it "found a direct relationship of sodium intake with later mortality over 20 years of follow-up," she said.</p>

<p>That means those with the lowest salt intake seem to have the lowest odds of dying early. She also pointed out that this study included healthy men and women who didn't have high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart disease. That meant there was less potential bias from these factors, Cook explained.</p>

<p>"Our results found the lowest mortality among those consuming the lowest levels of sodium, and we believe they are more accurate than results from other studies," she added.</p>

<p>For the new research, the investigators included two studies in which participants were either counseled on reducing how much salt they ate or were left to eat as much as they wanted. These studies—Trials of Hypertension Prevention I and II—were designed to see if reducing salt could prevent high blood pressure. Salt intake was measured with regular urine samples.</p>

<p>There were 744 people in the phase 1 trial and nearly 2,400 people in the phase 2 trial who restricted their salt intake. Two hundred and fifty-one people in the salt-restriction group died during the study. Among nearly 3,000 people who weren't asked to restrict their salt, 272 died, Cook's team found.</p>

<p>The first trial was conducted from 1987 to 1990 and the second from 1990 to 1995.</p>
 
<p>Samantha Heller is a senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. She said, "We do not eat single minerals or single vitamins—we eat food. So a diet that is very high in salt is likely due to a dietary pattern."</p>

<p>The Western diet is loaded with prepared, frozen, junky, highly processed, poor-quality foods, laden with added salt, Heller said.</p>

<p>"These kinds of diets raise the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, obesity and other diseases for many reasons, including the fact that they are high in salt," she said.</p>

<p>The authors of an accompanying journal editorial said this study and previous ones "support modest reductions in sodium intake among persons consuming high-sodium diets," along with a healthy diet.</p>

<p>The editorial authors, Andrew Mente of McMaster University in Ontario and colleagues, also called for a randomized, controlled clinical trial of a low- versus moderate-intake salt diet to get a clearer idea of how salt consumption affects death risk.</p>

    <![CDATA[Yes, it is possible to get everything you need&nbsp;with a purely plant-based diet.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>As you can probably tell from&nbsp;the number of plant-based recipes popping up on your social media feed, and that new vegan restaurant that just opened down the block, veganism is on the rise. According to one poll, about&nbsp;2.5% of Americans&nbsp;identify&nbsp;as vegan,&nbsp;meaning they adhere to a diet that omits all <a href="http://www.vrg.org/blog/2011/12/05/how-many-adults-are-vegan-in-the-u-s/">animal-derived foods and ingredients</a>. But&nbsp;experts&nbsp;still can&rsquo;t seem to agree whether veganism&nbsp;is an optimal diet.</p>

<p>The latest group to take a stand is the German Nutrition Society. The organization has published a paper&nbsp;that states,&nbsp;&quot;[w]ith a <a href="https://www.ernaehrungs-umschau.de/fileadmin/Ernaehrungs-Umschau/pdfs/pdf_2016/04_16/EU04_2016_Special_DGE_eng_final.pdf">pure plant-based diet</a>,&nbsp;it is difficult or impossible to attain an adequate supply of some nutrients.&quot;</p>

<p>In my opinion and experience, it is certainly not &quot;impossible.&quot; Vegans and omnivores alike&nbsp;can get all the&nbsp;nutrients their bodies&nbsp;need, in the right balance. It&#39;s just that&nbsp;vegan diets need to be &quot;appropriately planned,&quot; as the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/vegetarian-diets" href="http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/vegetarian-diets">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has&nbsp;pointed out</a>.</p>

<p>The German report named 10 nutrients of critical concern: vitamin B12, protein, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, riboflavin, vitamin D, calcium, iron, iodine, zinc, and selenium. If you&rsquo;re vegan&mdash;or thinking of going vegan&mdash;here are four important steps you can take to ensure you consume an adequate amount of each.</p>

<h3><strong>Meet with a dietitian</strong></h3>

<p>A vegan diet should be personalized, so I recommend&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/30/6-things-you-should-know-about-working-with-a-nutritionist-dietitian/?hootPostID=0178e9e302582d86951f41cfad61e2ce" href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/30/6-things-you-should-know-about-working-with-a-nutritionist-dietitian/?hootPostID=0178e9e302582d86951f41cfad61e2ce">consulting with a dietitian</a>&nbsp;who specializes in plant-based diets. When I meet with clients who are vegan or want to make this transition, I dive deep into exactly what they do and don&rsquo;t eat, along with their usual eating pattern.</p>

<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve had some vegan clients who are also picky eaters;&nbsp;others had&nbsp;food sensitivities that prevented them from eating certain nutrient-rich&nbsp;foods.&nbsp;Taking a complete &ldquo;food inventory&rdquo; allows me to determine whether dietary supplements are needed, and if so, the right types and amounts.</p>

<p>All of this can be difficult to sort through by yourself.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve had some clients who bought supplements without any guidance,&nbsp;and mistakenly took too little&nbsp;or too much. Too much can also be risky. <a href="http://www.health.com/digestive-health/zinc-antibiotics-infection">Excess zinc</a> for example may actually suppress immunity, lower &ldquo;good&rdquo; HDL cholesterol, or even trigger nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and headaches. Too much calcium is tied to <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20920856,00.html">constipation</a>, <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20934889,00.html">kidney stones</a>, and may damage the kidneys and heart over time.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t meet with a dietitian, at least consult an expert reference. I highly recommend the book&nbsp;<em><a data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Vegan-Complete-Adopting-Plant-Based/dp/1570671036/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474854614&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=going+vegan" href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Vegan-Complete-Adopting-Plant-Based/dp/1570671036/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474854614&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=going+vegan" target="_blank">Becoming Vegan</a></em>, written by two RDs.</p>

<h3><strong>Plan ahead and carry &ldquo;back-up&rdquo; food</strong></h3>

<p>It may be easier to find vegan options these days, but I&#39;ve had vegan clients tell me they skipped meals because they couldn&rsquo;t find something suitable when they were on the go, or in a non-vegan-friendly social situation. While I definitely advocate for &ldquo;real food&rdquo; first, sometimes a vegan protein&nbsp;bar can mean the difference between falling seriously short on several nutrients, or more closely hitting the mark.</p>

<p>My favorite &ldquo;clean&rdquo; vegan bars include&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amrita-Protein-Chocolate-Maca-Nutrition/dp/B00MMLFGJU/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475187182&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=amrita+chocolate+maca" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amrita-Protein-Chocolate-Maca-Nutrition/dp/B00MMLFGJU/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475187182&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=amrita+chocolate+maca">Amrita&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;chocolate maca (with 15 grams of plant-based protein);&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-High-Protein-Lemon-Cashew-12-Count/dp/B00HFY0YSW/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475187258&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rise+lemon+cashew" href="https://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-High-Protein-Lemon-Cashew-12-Count/dp/B00HFY0YSW/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475187258&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rise+lemon+cashew">Rise&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;plant-based bars, specifically the lemon cashew and sunflower cinnamon (with 15 grams of protein each); and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Squarebar-Organic-Protein-Variety-Flavor_/dp/B013X6BYPM/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475187317&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=square+bar" href="https://www.amazon.com/Squarebar-Organic-Protein-Variety-Flavor_/dp/B013X6BYPM/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475187317&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=square+bar">Square&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;organic bars (which have&nbsp;11-13 grams of protein).</p>

<p>I suggest carrying a few bars with you wherever you go, just in case. And download a GPS app like&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/food-tripping/id633720942?mt=8" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/food-tripping/id633720942?mt=8">Food Tripping</a>,&nbsp;to scope out nearby eateries&nbsp;with&nbsp;vegan options.</p>

<h3><strong>Invest in&nbsp;vegan cookbooks</strong></h3>

<p>One of the keys to meeting your nutrient needs on a vegan diet is to eat a wide variety of foods. People often get stuck in a&nbsp;rut, eating the same meals over and over. Even if the meal is healthy, you may be missing out on nutrients by not rotating in other plant-based foods.</p>

<p>For example, salads loaded with greens and veggies are great;&nbsp;but without the addition of a regular variety of&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/04/03/keep-the-carbs-lose-the-pounds/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/04/03/keep-the-carbs-lose-the-pounds/" target="_blank">pulses</a>&nbsp;(beans, lentils and peas),&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/16/5-genius-ways-to-use-almonds/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/16/5-genius-ways-to-use-almonds/" target="_blank">nuts</a>,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20901362,00.html" href="http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20901362,00.html" target="_blank">seeds</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/11/13/8-awesome-whole-grains-youre-not-eating/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/11/13/8-awesome-whole-grains-youre-not-eating/" target="_blank">whole grains</a>, the spectrum of nutrients in your bowl may be far too narrow.</p>

<p>One of my favorite cookbooks, offering a wide range of recipes, is Sharon Palmer&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><a data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Plant-Powered-Life-Lasting-Delicious-Recipes/dp/1615191879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474854918&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sharon+palmer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Plant-Powered-Life-Lasting-Delicious-Recipes/dp/1615191879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474854918&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sharon+palmer" target="_blank">Plant-Powered for Life</a></em>.</p>

<p>And again, keep in mind that you may need to take supplements for certain nutrients.</p>

<h3><strong>Consider being vegan-ish</strong></h3>

<p>I know that for those who avoid animal-based foods and ingredients for animal rights and ethical reasons, being vegan-ish is not an option. But I do have clients who&rsquo;ve gone vegan with the goal of improving their health. Some find it easier to meet their nutrient needs when they&rsquo;re &ldquo;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/03/20/5-habits-of-vegetarians-you-should-steal/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/03/20/5-habits-of-vegetarians-you-should-steal/" target="_blank">mostly vegan,</a>&rdquo; by adding in some&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/02/16/how-to-eat-all-the-fish-you-want-minus-the-mercury-danger/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/02/16/how-to-eat-all-the-fish-you-want-minus-the-mercury-danger/" target="_blank">low-mercury</a>&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/24/tips-for-cooking-fish/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/24/tips-for-cooking-fish/" target="_blank">seafood</a>&nbsp;or organic eggs, for example.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve even had some clients tell me that they found veganism too challenging, and rebounded back to their previous animal-heavy diet that lacked healthy plant foods like produce, whole grains, pulses, nuts and seeds. Obviously that&#39;s not a healthier path. So I like to remind those clients that veganism doesn&rsquo;t have to be all or nothing. If you&rsquo;re health-focused rather than animal-rights focused, being mostly vegan may be the best way to strike a balance, and stick with a healthy eating pattern long-term.</p>

    <![CDATA[Daily protein intake isn&#39;t necessarily the same for everyone&mdash;here&#39;s how to determine how much you should be aiming for.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>Wondering exactly how much protein you should be consuming each day?&nbsp;The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), which is the minimum amount you need to be healthy, is 0.8 grams per kilogram (0.36 grams per pound) of body weight per day&mdash;46 grams for an average woman. That equals as little as 10% of daily calories. If you&#39;re not super active, that&#39;s likely adequate, and you&#39;ll hit the target effortlessly if you follow a typical Western diet.</p>

<p>To get your personal protein &quot;RDA,&quot; multiple the number 0.36 by your weight in pounds. (For a sedentary 150-pound woman, that would be 54 grams.) Double it if you&#39;re very active or aiming for &quot;optimal protein,&quot; which can help you maintain muscle as you age and support weight loss.</p>

<p>American women already eat about 68 grams a day, according to the latest data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. &quot;There&#39;s no reason to go out of your way to get protein,&quot; says Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, dean of the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science &amp; Policy. &quot;Just eat a variety of fish, nuts, beans, seeds, and dairy, including yogurt.&quot;&nbsp;However, increasing your protein well above the RDA may make sense if...</p>

<h3><strong>You&#39;re very active</strong></h3>

<p>That means getting at least 35 to 40 minutes of moderate exercise four or five days a week, including resistance training two or more times a week. Consider eating 1.2 to 2 grams of dietary protein per kilogram (or about 0.5 to 0.9 grams per pound) of body weight each day, says Nancy Rodriguez, PhD, professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Connecticut. That amount is best for rebuilding muscle tissue, especially if you do a lot of high-intensity workouts, research suggests.</p>

<h3><strong>You&#39;re trying to lose weight</strong></h3>

<p>Protein takes longer to digest than carbs, helping you feel full, and also pushes your body to secrete the gut hormone peptide YY, which reduces hunger. &quot;When you bring protein to about 30% of your daily calories, you&#39;ll naturally eat less,&quot; says Lauren Slayton, RD, founder of Foodtrainers, a nutrition practice in New York City, and author of <em>The Little Book of Thin</em>. &quot;Protein decreases appetite and also, in my experience, helps you manage cravings.&quot;</p>

<p>While studies are mixed about whether consuming more protein leads to weight loss, research is pretty clear that protein can help you retain more of your lean muscle as you lose fat. One 2011 study suggests amping up protein to as much as 1.8 to 2 grams per kilogram (roughly 0.8 to 0.9 grams per pound) of body weight per day to stave off muscle loss when restricting calories. Cut back on refined carbs to balance out the extra calories from adding protein.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>You&#39;re in middle age</strong></h3>

<p>Eating more protein as you get older may help you maintain muscle and ward off <a href="http://www.health.com/osteoporosis" target="_blank">osteoporosis</a>, &quot;so you can stay stronger and more functional,&quot; says Rodriguez. In a 2015 study, adults over the age of 50 who roughly doubled the RDA (eating 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram, or 0.68 grams per pound, of body weight) were better able to rebuild and retain muscle after only four days, compared with control groups eating the RDA.</p>

<p>Doubling the RDA gives you &quot;optimal protein,&quot; a concept that Rodriguez and more than 40 nutrition scientists advanced at a recent Protein Summit, the findings from which were published in 2015 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Optimal protein works out to be about 15% to 25% of your daily calories, still below the level recommended by many popular high-protein diets. Over a day, that could look like 20-30 grams per meal and 12 to 15 grams per snack, for a total of 90 to 105 grams daily.&nbsp;</p>

    <![CDATA[A nutritionist weighs in on the latest research about these essential fatty acids.
]]>  </description>
  <content:encoded>
    <![CDATA[<p>You know that omega-3 essential fatty acids can&nbsp;do your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/heart-disease">heart</a> and brain&nbsp;a world of good.&nbsp;But new research&nbsp;suggests that a high intake may&nbsp;be linked to an increased <a href="http://www.health.com/type-2-diabetes">risk of diabetes</a>.&nbsp;So what does that mean, exactly?</p>

<p>The honest answer: We don&#39;t know. For the French study, which&nbsp;was presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes General Assembly, researchers tracked the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160913184945.htm" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160913184945.htm">omega-3&nbsp;intake</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;more than&nbsp;70,000 women. They found that those with the highest intake&nbsp;were more likely to be diagnosed with <a href="http://www.health.com/type-2-diabetes">type 2 diabetes</a> over a 14-year period.</p>

<p>But when the&nbsp;scientists looked more closely at different types of omega-3s,&nbsp;DPA (docosapentaenoic acid)&mdash;which is found in some fish and other animal foods&mdash;stood out.&nbsp;Women who consumed the most&nbsp;DPA&nbsp;had a 45% greater chance of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes&nbsp;compared to women who consumed the least. For overweight women, the risk climbed to&nbsp;54%. In these women&#39;s diets, meat was the top source of DPA.</p>

<p>But more research is needed, and many questions remain unanswered, including&nbsp;the potential impact of other foods the women ate, or didn&#39;t eat.&nbsp;For example, after a&nbsp;2011 study found a link between <a data-mce-href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/93/1/143.abstract?ijkey=5ca40fcb8cb595948f1f889ea15e7b46f1abc04d&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/93/1/143.abstract?ijkey=5ca40fcb8cb595948f1f889ea15e7b46f1abc04d&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">omega-3-rich seafood</a>&nbsp;and type 2 diabetes<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>experts speculated that <a data-mce-href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/94/2/617.1.full" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/94/2/617.1.full">if a person&#39;s antioxidant intake was low</a>, omega-3s could make tissue more susceptible to oxidation, and&nbsp;trigger a domino effect that could lead to type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20986165,00.html">13 Healthy High-Fat Foods You Should Eat</a></strong></p>

<p>In other words: It&#39;s your <em>whole</em> diet that matters, not just one nutrient.&nbsp;That&#39;s why I recommend eating&nbsp;seafood and other sources of omega-3s as part of a <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20793870,00.html">Mediterranean eating pattern</a>, rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, plant-based fats, and herbs and spices&mdash;all sources of antioxidants.</p>

<p>Consuming omega-3s in this diet is likely to be far more protective than eating them within a traditional American diet, which is generally low in plant foods and too high in processed grains, sugar, and animal products.</p>

<p>So until we know more about the possible&nbsp;omega-3-diabetes link, focus on these eight key&nbsp;healthy eating strategies, to maximize your antioxidant intake and create balance in your diet.</p>

<h3><strong>Keep eating omega-3 rich seafood</strong></h3>

<p>But cook it in healthy ways (click here for <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/24/tips-for-cooking-fish/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/24/tips-for-cooking-fish/">my tips</a>). And be mindful of your overall eating pattern.</p>

<h3><strong>Include veggies in as many meals as possible</strong></h3>

<p>Especially meals&nbsp;that contain animal-based foods. Whip greens into a smoothie, or add them to omelets for breakfast. Opt for salads over sandwiches at lunch. At dinner, aim to fill half of your plate with veggies, whether they&#39;re oven roasted,&nbsp;saut&eacute;ed, stir-fried, or in a salad.</p>

<h3><strong>Eat&nbsp;fruit at breakfast&nbsp;and as a daily snack</strong></h3>

<p>If you get tired of&nbsp;fruit-based snacks, munch on&nbsp;veggies paired with hummus, tahini, olive tapenade, or guacamole. More smart&nbsp;options: nuts, seeds, and olives.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Use plenty of antioxidant-rich natural seasonings</strong></h3>

<p>Add fresh grated ginger, cinnamon, or mint to a smoothie or yogurt parfait at breakfast. Add turmeric and black pepper to eggs. Sprinkle fresh herbs, like basil, on salads. Cook with garlic, as well as fresh or dried herbs and spices, including oregano, rosemary, cloves, and cumin.</p>

<h3><strong>Have pulses&nbsp;in place of meat</strong></h3>

<p>Or at least go half and half. You could also use <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/04/03/keep-the-carbs-lose-the-pounds/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/04/03/keep-the-carbs-lose-the-pounds/" target="_blank">pulses</a> (beans, lentils, and peas, like chickpeas) in place of grains. For example, you could serve seafood over lentils instead of rice.</p>

<h3><strong>Add plant-based fats to every meal</strong></h3>

<p>They&#39;re anti-inflammatory and full of antioxidants. Think&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/09/12/5-amazing-powers-of-avocado/?hootPostID=189e6b01a97850338f4b6fc681e4b435" href="http://news.health.com/2014/09/12/5-amazing-powers-of-avocado/?hootPostID=189e6b01a97850338f4b6fc681e4b435" target="_blank">avocado</a>, <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2016/02/25/heres-how-to-get-the-most-health-perks-possible-from-olive-oil/" href="http://news.health.com/2016/02/25/heres-how-to-get-the-most-health-perks-possible-from-olive-oil/" target="_blank">extra virgin olive oil</a>, <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/16/5-genius-ways-to-use-almonds/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/01/16/5-genius-ways-to-use-almonds/" target="_blank">nuts</a>, <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/03/14/5-awesome-food-trends-worth-trying/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/03/14/5-awesome-food-trends-worth-trying/" target="_blank">seeds</a>, and nut and&nbsp;seed butters. You could spread whole grain toast with ripe avocado or almond butter instead of butter, for example. Dress salads with olive oil-based vinaigrette in place of creamy dressing. Use EVOO rather than butter to saut&eacute; veggies. And top cooked fish, meat, or eggs with sliced avocado or chopped nuts.</p>

<h3><strong>Minimize or nix highly processed foods</strong></h3>

<p>That includes refined grains like <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/07/08/3-delicious-ways-to-kick-the-white-bread-habit/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/07/08/3-delicious-ways-to-kick-the-white-bread-habit/" target="_blank">white flour bread</a> and white rice, <a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/02/14/5-ways-to-eat-less-sugar/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/02/14/5-ways-to-eat-less-sugar/" target="_blank">sugar-filled</a> drinks, candy, and desserts.</p>

<h3><strong>Cut back on animal products that aren&rsquo;t produced with natural or organic methods</strong></h3>

<p>These products have healthier fat profiles and lack hormones and antibiotics, making them much better options for your well-being.
