## Run Instructions

1. log into server and check `mvn -version` to make sure it is using Java version 1.7 (some servers are not and the build will fail)
2. cd to project root
3. package program: <br/>`mvn clean package`
4. execute jar: <br/>`java -jar target/project2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <bing account key> <t_es> <t_ec> <host>`



## Internal Design
This project classifies a web database using the QProber algorithm, and constructs a document summary for every category the database is classified into.

<br/> <br/>
The Bing Search API is used to issue query probes to a given web database and retrieve the total number of results for the probe as well as the top web results. The project includes a utility class called BingService that provides this functionality. It accepts a website and a query, and searches the website using Bing APIs.

<br/> <br/>
The main component of this project is the QProber class. This implements the QProber procedure. For a given website, specificity threshold and coverage threshold it uses the BingService internally to issue (pre-defined) query probes to the website and classify the website into appropriate categories as defined by the algorithm. Note that a website can be classified into multiple categories, and if a website is classified in a subcategory (e.g. Root/Health/Fitness) this means it is also classified in all parent categories (i.e. Root and Root/Health). The QProber output thus only explicitly specifies the inner-most classification(s) (e.g. Root/Health/Fitness).

<br/> <br/>
In addition to classifying the website, QProber also constructs a document sample (list of urls) for all categories the website was classified into as defined in the part 2-a of the project description.

<br/> <br/>
The final step is using the document sample generated by QProber to construct document summaries. The component responsible for this is the ContentSummarizer class. Given a category and its document sample (list of urls), it fetches the document and computes the document frequency for every word and finally produces an output document summary file.


<br/><br/>
Notes: <br/>
- Unlike the reference implementation, we do not include multiple word query probes in the document summary output. <br/>
- We implement caching for both Bing results as well as for the content of actual pages retrieved to construct document summaries.
